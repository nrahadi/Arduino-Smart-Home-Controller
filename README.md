This module was made as an integrated smart home controller using arduino. Different sensors are utilized to control the air conditiong systems, indoor/outdoor lightning, and door/gate locks for home safety.

In this module, DHT22 sensor is used to control the air conditioning system within specified temperature threshold.
PIR Motion sensor is used to lit the indoor light if any movement in the covered area is detected.
Photoresistor sensor is used to lit the outdoor light if the sun in started to going down.
Push Buttons is used to open the garage gate.
And keypad and LCD display is utilized as an I/O device for smart door lock module.

Both indoor and outdoor light are actuated with LED lights as well as the fan, while the door lock is actuated with a servo.
